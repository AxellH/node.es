h1. Node gadgets for Elastic Search

h2. Proxy server

Basically, the "proxy":http://github.com/lukas-vlcek/node.es/tree/master/proxy/ server can do the following for you:
* It can restrict access to Elastic Search REST API (defaults to _safe_ operations only).
* You can provide handlers to modify HTTP client request (e.g. you can ensure that @size@ is not too big) and Elastic Search response (e.g. you can remove sensitive data).
* It can round-robin client requests among active HTTP enabled nodes (it periodically refreshes list of active nodes), thus, it can provide a single URL for clients to communicate with Elastic Search cluster.

You can find simple example in "proxy-example.js":http://github.com/lukas-vlcek/node.es/blob/master/proxy/proxy-example.js
More detailed documenation can be found in source code of "elasticsearch-proxy.js":http://github.com/lukas-vlcek/node.es/blob/master/proxy/elasticsearch-proxy.js
